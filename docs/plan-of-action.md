# Plan of Action: EduClinic (Alumni-Student Connect Platform)

This document outlines the systematic plan of action for building the EduClinic platform. The goal is to provide a structured approach to development, allowing for clear presentation of progress and milestones.

## 1. Project Overview & Scope

EduClinic is a platform designed to bridge the gap between alumni and students. It facilitates networking, mentorship, and event participation.

**Key User Roles:**
*   **Students:** Can register for events, view the gallery, follow alumni, and contact them.
*   **Alumni:** Can create posts, mentor students, and share insights.
*   **Admins:** Manage users, oversee platform activity, and moderate content.

## 2. Feature Breakdown & Modules

### Module A: User Management & Authentication
*   User registration and login (Student/Alumni/Admin).
*   Profile creation and management (avatars, bio, links).
*   Role-based access control (RBAC).

### Module B: Networking & Connectivity
*   **Follow System:** Students can follow alumni.
*   **Messaging/Contact System:** Secure channels for students to contact alumni.

### Module C: Event Management
*   Event creation (by Admins or authorized Alumni).
*   Event listing and details page.
*   Student event registration and ticketing/RSVP.

### Module D: Media & Gallery
*   Centralized photo/video gallery for past events and campus life.
*   Media upload and categorization.

## 3. Development Phases (Timeline)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
*   Project initialization (Client, Server, Admin Portal).
*   Database schema design.
*   Authentication system implementation.
*   Basic UI layout and design system setup.

### Phase 2: Core User Features
*   User profiles (Alumni and Students).
*   Alumni post creation and feed functionality.
*   Follow system integration.

### Phase 3: Engagement & Events
*   Messaging/Contact functionality.

## 4. Technical Architecture (Current)

Based on the repository structure:
*   **Frontend (Client):** Main user-facing application for Students and Alumni.
*   **Backend (Server):** API handling business logic, database interactions, and authentication.
*   **Admin Portal:** Dedicated interface for platform administration.
*   **Infrastructure:** Dockerized setup (`docker-compose.yml`) for consistent development and deployment.
